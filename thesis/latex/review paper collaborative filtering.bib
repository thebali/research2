abstract = {In many commercial systems, the â€˜best bet' recommenda- tions are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top- N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recom- mender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accu- racy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non- personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, re- gardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other rec- ommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommenda- tion task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.},

@article{Bamber1975,
abstract = {Receiver operating characteristic graphs are shown to be a variant form of ordinal dominance graphs. The area above the latter graph and the area below the former graph are useful measures of both the size or importance of a difference between two populations and/or the accuracy of discrimination performance. The usual estimator for this area is closely related to the Mann-Whitney U statistic. Statistical literature on this area estimator is reviewed. For large sample sizes, the area estimator is approximately normally distributed. Formulas for the variance and the maximum variance of the area estimator are given. Several different methods of constructing confidence intervals for the area measure are presented and the strengths and weaknesses of each of these methods are discussed. Finally, the Appendix presents the derivation of a new mathematical result, the maximum variance of the area estimator over convex ordinal dominance graphs.},

@article{Wei2017,
abstract = {Recommender system is a specific type of intelligent systems, which exploits historical user ratings on items and/or auxiliary information to make recommendations on items to the users. It plays a critical role in a wide range of online shopping, e-commercial services and social networking applications. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommender systems, but it suffers from complete cold start (CCS) problem where no rating record are available and incomplete cold start (ICS) problem where only a small number of rating records are available for some new items or users in the system. In this paper, we propose two recommendation models to solve the CCS and ICS problems for new items, which are based on a framework of tightly coupled CF approach and deep learning neural network. A specific deep neural network SADE is used to extract the content features of the items. The state of the art CF model, timeSVD++, which models and utilizes temporal dynamics of user preferences and item features, is modified to take the content features into prediction of ratings for cold start items. Extensive experiments on a large Netflix rating dataset of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation models largely outperform the baseline models for rating prediction of cold start items. The two proposed recommendation models are also evaluated and compared on ICS items, and a flexible scheme of model retraining and switching is proposed to deal with the transition of items from cold start to non-cold start status. The experiment results on Netflix movie recommendation show the tight coupling of CF approach and deep learning neural network is feasible and very effective for cold start item recommendation. The design is general and can be applied to many other recommender systems for online shopping and social networking applications. The solution of cold start item problem can largely improve user experience and trust of recommender systems, and effectively promote cold start items.},
