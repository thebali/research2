\chapter{Privacy-Preserving Aspects}
Personal integrity is a frequently discussed topic in the connected world.
Most new products today come with the feature of being able to use the Internet; phones, clocks, cars, TVs, baby monitors and even entire households etc.
There are more devices connected to the Internet than there are people living on the planet earth [52]. Being able to stay connected around the clock every day of the month has shed some light on new ethical dilemmas and issues. Internet started out as a place where its users were more or less anonymous. But despite the efforts in present time, creating techniques so as to be more or less anonymous online, a very small portion of the connected world actually make use of these kind of techniques. Applications on our smart devices ask for much more privileges than what their functionality
requires, most of the time. This, however, is the case for most online-based systems in general. People are naive most of the time so as to trust systems and applications with whatever personal information they might ask for. This kind of data can then be sold to companies, authorities or in the worst case, hacked or stolen.

\section{General Aspects of Personal Integrity}
Smart phone applications are a big part of many people’s lives. They are used for browsing social medias, calendar and scheduling, public transport, work-out, calorie-tracking, storage, e-commerce and just about anything else. Commonly applications do not ask for any privileges when they are new. However, as the amount of users increase one can be certain that sooner or later the application might ask for extended privileges [53] such as access to files, text-messages, contacts and in some cases even camera and GPS. Most people do not see an issue with this, if it is a good application. In many cases this might not even be a problem. Commonly, regular people, would not complain about an applications performing movie, TV-shows or shopping recommendations despite using all possible private data, as long as the recommendations are valid. In many cases, data

changes hands every now and then. Mostly probably because of being sold. What most
people do not think of is the fact that once data hits the Internet, it is out of control.
Most of the time one can never be sure where its personal data ends up. The more
places containing our personal data, the bigger the chance is of it getting leaked, hacked
or stolen[54].
These issues are obviously not limited to smart phone applications. It concerns other
applications that possess personal information as well. It could be games, e-commerce
systems, normal web sites and systems connected to the web in general. It becomes
relevant in e-commerce platforms that make use of complex recommender systems and
personalised predictions, as those personalised predictions are based on personal information, actions and behaviour in the system. See Chapter 2 for more about recommender
systems.
To this comes ethical dilemmas; People actively choose to provide companies with their
personal data through consistent use of their applications and products. From the aspect
of the groups possessing this kind of data, what is ethically acceptable to do with it?
Could it be sold or distributed freely? See [55] and [56] for further research on this topic.

A Privacy-Preserving User Approach

There are several techniques, of which most are very easy to use, the regular user can
apply to achieve good privacy when browsing the web. Other than common sense such
as to be careful and critical, normal methods are through use of proxy servers and virtual
private networks. One of the more popular techniques as of last years are through use
of onion routing protocols [57].
Onion routing means using layers of encryption where each layer consists of decryption at individual nodes. After decryption is done at each individual node the next
destination node, in the chain of nodes, is uncovered. As the message reaches the final
destination there should be only one layer of encryption left, which when decrypted provides the original message. Because of each individual node only knowing the location of
the immediately preceding and following nodes, the original sender remains anonymous.
To create and transmit the message initially, an initiator node selects a set of nodes
from a list provided by a leader node. The initiator node then obtains a public key
from the leader node to send an encrypted message to the first node in the chain, using
asymmetric key cryptography to establish a connection and a shared session key[58].

Privacy-Preserving Systems

Privacy-Preserving systems is an area where much research has been made the last
century[5, 19, 59], but despite this very little of the research is being applied in commercial systems. And this for several reasons such as companies wanting to make use of

personal features to improve their systems and the user-experience as a whole, but also
for more controversial reasons as those mentioned in 4.1.

4.3.1

Developing a Privacy-Preserving System

Generally you could describe a privacy-preserving system as a system which is developed
so as to actively avoid using or even asking for personal data[19, 59]. Although, privacypreserving systems can contain various levels of privacy where the highest level of privacy
would be total anonymity. Obviously some systems are more privacy-preserving than
others. Examples of lower levels of privacy are systems that only make use of usersubmitted data or data that a user actively choose to provide the service or system
with. Among the lowest levels of privacy are systems that record user-activity and behaviour of actions performed by users. Personal data that can be used, perhaps by
the system itself, to classify users in ways that might or might not be more or less
ethically acceptable.
