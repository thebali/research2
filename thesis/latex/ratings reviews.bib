abstract = {Recommender system has been recognized as a superior way for solving personal information overload problem. Rating, as an evaluation criteria revealing how much a customer likes a product, has been a foundation of recommender systems for a long period based on the popular latent factor models. However, review texts as the valuable user generated content have been neglected all the time. Recently, models integrating ratings and review texts as training sources have attracted a lot of attention, which may model review texts by topic model or its variants and then link latent factor vectors to topic distribution of review texts. For that, the integrated models need complicated optimization algorithms to fuse the heterogeneous sources, that may cause greater errors. In this work, we aim to propose a novel model, called Aspect-based Latent Factor Model (ALFM) to integrate ratings and review texts via latent factor model, in which by integrating rating matrix, user-review matrix and item-attribute matrix, the user latent factors and item latent factors with word latent factors can be derived. Our proposed model aggregates all review texts of the same user on the respective items and builds a user-review matrix by word frequencies. Similarly, an item's review is considered as all review texts of the same item collected from respective users. According to different information abstracted from review texts, we introduce two different kinds of item-attribute matrix to integrate the item-word frequencies and polarity scores of corresponding words. Experimental results on real-world data sets from amazon.com illustrate that our model can not only perform better than traditional models and art-of-state models on rating prediction task, but also accomplish cross-domain task through transferring word embedding.},

abstract = {Although latent factor models (e.g., matrix factorization) achieve good accuracy in rating prediction, they suffer from several problems including cold-start, non-transparency, and suboptimal recommendation for local users or items. In this paper, we employ textual review information with ratings to tackle these limitations. Firstly, we apply a proposed aspect-aware topic model (ATM) on the review text to model user preferences and item features from different aspects, and estimate the aspect importance of a user towards an item. The aspect importance is then integrated into a novel aspect-aware latent factor model (ALFM), which learns user's and item's latent factors based on ratings. In particular, ALFM introduces a weighted matrix to associate those latent factors with the same set of aspects discovered by ATM, such that the latent factors could be used to estimate aspect ratings. Finally, the overall rating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings, which are weighted by the corresponding aspect importance. To this end, our model could alleviate the data sparsity problem and gain good interpretability for recommendation. Besides, an aspect rating is weighted by an aspect importance, which is dependent on the targeted user's preferences and targeted item's features. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed method can model a user's preferences on an item more accurately for each user-item pair locally. Comprehensive experimental studies have been conducted on 19 datasets from Amazon and Yelp 2017 Challenge dataset. Results show that our method achieves significant improvement compared with strong baseline methods, especially for users with only few ratings. Moreover, our model could interpret the recommendation results in depth.},

abstract = {An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.},

abstract = {Most existing recommender systems focus on modeling the rat- ings while ignoring the abundant information embedded in the re- view text. In this paper, we propose a unified model that com- bines content-based filtering with collaborative filtering, harness- ing the information of both ratings and reviews. We apply topic modeling techniques on the review text and align the topics with rating dimensions to improve prediction accuracy. With the in- formation embedded in the review text, we can alleviate the cold- start problem. Furthermore, our model is able to learn latent top- ics that are interpretable. With these interpretable topics, we can explore the prior knowledge on items or users and recommend completely “cold” items. Empirical study on 27 classes of real- life datasets show that our proposed model lead to significant im- provement compared with strong baseline methods, especially for datasets which are extremely sparse where rating-only methods can- not make accurate predictions.

@article{Ganu2009,
abstract = {Online reviews are an important asset for users deciding to buy a product, see a movie, or go to a restaurant, as well as for busi- nesses tracking user feedback. However, most reviews are written in a free-text format, and are therefore dif cult for computer sys- tems to understand, analyze, and aggregate. One consequence of this lack of structure is that searching text reviews is often frus- trating for users. User experience would be greatly improved if the structure and sentiment conveyed in the content of the reviews were taken into account. Our work focuses on identifying this in- formation from free-form text reviews, and using the knowledge to improve user experience in accessing reviews. Speci cally, we focused on improving recommendation accuracy in a restaurant re- view scenario. In this paper, we report on our classi cation effort, and on the insight on user-reviewing behavior that we gained in the process. We propose new ad-hoc and regression-based recommen- dation measures, that both take into account the textual component of user reviews. Our results show that using textual information re- sults in better general or personalized review score predictions than those derived from the numerical star ratings given by the users.},

abstract = {Despite the popularity of online food and grocery shopping, little research has been conducted to understand the factors that influence consumers' online food purchases. Using a topic modeling approach, our results show four interpretable factors have significant impacts on the helpfulness of customer reviews: Amazon Service, Physical Feature, Flavor Feature, and Subjective Expression. Readers of customer reviews perceive objective reviews as more helpful than subjective reviews. In addition, customer review helpfulness has a concave relationship with the length of the reviews. Our results provide important business implications on how to encourage more helpful reviews to assist potential shoppers in making better purchase decisions.},

@article{Chen2015,
abstract = {In recent years, a variety of review-based recommender systems have been developed, with the goal of incorporating the valuable information in user-generated textual reviews into the user modeling and recommending process. Advanced text analysis and opinion mining tech-niques enable the extraction of various types of review elements, such as the discussed topics, the multi-faceted nature of opinions, contextual information, comparative opinions, and reviewers' emotions. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of how the review elements have been exploited to improve standard content-based recommending, collaborative filtering, and preference-based product ranking techniques. The review-based recommender system's ability to alleviate the well-known rating sparsity and cold-start problems is emphasized. This survey classifies state-of-the-art studies into two principal branches: review-based user profile building and review-based product profile building. In the user profile sub-branch, the reviews are not only used to create term-based profiles, but also to infer or enhance ratings. Multi-faceted opinions can further be exploited to derive the weight/value preferences that users place on particular features. In another sub-branch, the product profile can be enriched with feature opinions or comparative opinions to better reflect its assessment quality. The merit of each branch of work is discussed in terms of both algorithm development and the way in which the proposed algo-rithms are evaluated. In addition, we discuss several future trends based on the survey, which may inspire investigators to pursue additional studies in this area.},
