\section{Dataset}

\subsection{Data Gathering}
In order to get the required material to achieve this dissertation, files containing consumer reviews for diverse products derived from Amazon.com were used. These files were collected by Julian McAuley, researcher at the University of California, and were available on the following website: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. The extracted files only represented a subset of the data in which all items and users had at least 5 reviews (5-core). Duplicates, accounting for less than 1 percent of reviews, were removed.

This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014.

This dataset includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs). 

Each product review is provided with the following labels:
\begin{itemize}
\item reviewerID: the ID of the reviewer
\item asin (Amazon Standard Identification Number): the product ID of the item being reviewed
\item reviewerName: the name of the reviewer
\item helpful: helpfulness rating of the review (fraction of users who found the review helpful)
\item reviewText: the text of the review corresponding to the comment of the reviewer
\item overall: the rating of the product, out of five stars
\item summary: the summary of the review
\item unixReviewTime: time of the review (unix time)
\item reviewTime: time of the review in mm/dd/yyyy
\end{itemize}

Sample review:
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "reviewerID": "A2SUAM1J3GNN3B",
  "asin": "0000013714",
  "reviewerName": "J. McDonald",
  "helpful": [2, 3],
  "reviewText": "I bought this for my husband who plays the piano. He is having a 
  wonderful time playing these old hymns. The music is at times hard to read
  because we think the book was published for singing from more than playing from. 
  Great purchase though!",
  "overall": 5.0,
  "summary": "Heavenly Highway Hymns",
  "unixReviewTime": 1252800000,
  "reviewTime": "09 13, 2009"
}
\end{verbatim}

From these labels, we extracted the following columns for analysis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item asin: the product ID of the item being reviewed
	\item reviewText: the text review
	\item overall: the corresponding overall rating of the text review
	\item reviewerID: the amazon user id of the user who posted the review
\end{itemize}

The remaining elements were considered irrelevant in the scope of this thesis work, as our work mostly focuses on creating Rating Matrix, Document-term Matrix, and other matrices. This data was retrieved from the json files with the help of Python programming language.

The amazon dataset contains the product reviews that are categorised in the many categories. In the framework of this thesis, we have decided to analyse two specific dataset categories: Digital Music and Health \& Personal Care. These categories were chosen to justify the two yet broad themes in the recommender systems: Experience products and Search Products. 

Experience products can be defined as products whose quality is difficult to evaluate as it largely depends upon the taste of the different customers. With these kinds of products the user has to buy the product, test it, to form an opinion of the product and thereby evaluating the product to write a review about it. Digital Music was the appropriate fit for this category.

While, search products are products that can be objectively evaluated through key characteristics. This characteristic information can be taken from the website itself, user may not need to buy the product to test it. For this theme of the recommender system, we found that Health \& Personal Care section has the features to justify the product being bought as the user needs information, i.e. ingredients, dosage size, direction of use, etc.

To end, the size of both the datasets was large with upto 230,000 reviews for the largest one. An additional step was performed to \textbf{manage the dataset} to a resonable size. The dataset was reduced to 10,000 product reviews that have been randomly sampled from the original dataset. This was essentially done to perform the experiments and test the hypothesis efficiently.

The variables are chosen on the basis of 




\section{Implementation}




SVD()


• Always recommend items based on gender. (Men and women always buy the same
items as other men and women, respectively)
• Always recommend items based on age. (People at a certain age always buy same
items as other people in the same age)
• Always recommend items based on domicile. (People from city X always buy the
same items as other people from city X)
Baselines have been used before any other extensive evaluation method, something that
has been of great help when implementing the application, as these baselines can be seen
as evaluation in its most basic form.
