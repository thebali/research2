Hello , I am the student of your college. My name does not matter here, as it is the acknowledgement. I am writing this to acknowledge some people around me. First, my teacher, mentor, assigned guide for the complete masters degree. We all may not know, but she never wanted me as her student. Yet, I stuck there, here we are at the end of time at the College. She has helped me a lot for finding the what my research work was like. I still don't understand, what I want to say. But, this is important to increase the length of the content. I would like to thank her for all the efforts she has put into my work. She was there at each step for guiding to the next step of the thesis writing process.
