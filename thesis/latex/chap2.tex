\chapter{Recommender System}
Recommender system is and remains a hot topic within computer science in 2015. Huge conferences are hosted in different parts of the world annually, featuring many big companies. The RecSys conference [33] is a good example
of this. Recommender Systems has a wide use-area within all kinds of advertisement on the web when specifically targeted ads are needed. These ads can be seen everywhere from websites and apps to emails, text-messages etc. In the list of big actors on the stage of recommender systems, hardly surprisingly, one find companies such as Facebook, Google etc. But Recommender Systems are also used for recommending music in for instance Spotify and movies/TV-shows in Netflix. There are a variety of different algorithms for each use-area. The setting of which this thesis will focus consists
in algorithms for recommender systems within garment-based e-commerce. Here follows some of the more common general techniques used in recommender systems.
