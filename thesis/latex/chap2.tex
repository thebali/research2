\chapter{Recommender System}
Recommender system is and remains a hot topic within computer science in 2015. Huge conferences are hosted in different parts of the world annually, featuring many big companies. The RecSys conference [33] is a good example
of this. Recommender Systems has a wide use-area within all kinds of advertisement on the web when specifically targeted ads are needed. These ads can be seen everywhere from websites and apps to emails, text-messages etc. In the list of big actors on the stage of recommender systems, hardly surprisingly, one find companies such as Facebook, Google etc. But Recommender Systems are also used for recommending music in for instance Spotify and movies/TV-shows in Netflix. There are a variety of different algorithms for each use-area. The setting of which this thesis will focus consists
in algorithms for recommender systems within garment-based e-commerce. Here follows some of the more common general techniques used in recommender systems.


\section{Collaborative Filtering}
The basic idea of collaborative filtering is to find information or patterns using collaborative techniques among multiple data sources. Data sources typically consist of users and items such as movies, songs etc. Within e-commerce, and this project specifically, those data sources mainly consist of users, and products that can be bought by these users. Finding these patterns is accomplished through collecting and analysing huge amounts of data on users’ behaviours and activities as well as items. Within e-commerce those activities and behaviours include but are not limited to purchases and click-able ad- vertisements. Collaborative filtering[18] is one of the most common general methods for recommender systems being applicable within several big use-areas. Collaborative Filtering is frequently used in social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, mySpace, Twitter etc to effectively recommend new friends, pages, groups as well as who to follow or what to like. But also applications such as Youtube, Reddit, Netflix etc make use of collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is viable in all applications where one can observe connections between a user and their registered friends or followers. But it is also widely used within e-commerce, where Amazon is a good example who popularised algorithms for item-to-item based collaborative filtering [21].

Most Collaborative Filtering techniques can be expressed by the two general steps, Similarity Computation and Prediction Generation, described under 2.2

\subsection{User based collaborative filtering}
The main idea of recommender systems built on user-based collaborative filtering consists in computing the similarity between users’ {u,j} profiles, s u\textsubscript{j} . That is, computing a prediction for the probability of the user u liking a specific item i, consists in computing a rating based on all ratings made by users with similar profiles. All similar profiles contribute to this prediction depending on the similarity factor, s uj [34, 35, 36]. 

Typically this can be reduced to the two general steps. 
1. While observing a user’s actions in a system, look for similar users with equal behaviour- and activity-patterns. 
2. Use the observations from step 1 to compute a prediction for the specified user. 

See 2.2 for more information regarding Similarity Computation and Prediction Genera- tion techniques.

\subsection{Item based collaborative filtering}
The concept of item-based collaborative filtering applies the same idea as its User-based counterpart, but the similarity is computed between items instead of users, and is usually described as "Users who bought this also bought that". 

More generally, taking an item-based approach means looking into the set, I, of items a specific user, u, has rated, using their context to compute the similarity of other items, \{i\textsubscript{0} ,i\textsubscript{1} ,...,i\textsubscript{n} \}, not in I. Their corresponding similarities are computed at the same time as {s i0 ,s i1 ,...,s in }. When these similarities and their corresponding items have been found, a prediction can be computed. [36, 37, 38]. 
This can typically be split into three steps: 
1. Construct a User-Item matrix, M[u][i], giving each index of the matrix a rating, r ui , on an item i performed by a user u. 
2. Compute the similarity, s i\textsubscript{1}, i\textsubscript{2}, of two items i 1 and i 2 by looking at co-rated pairs from different users.
3. Generate predictions based on some prediction method, described under 2.2. Item-based collaborative filtering is a very common approach, often used together with algorithms for matrix factorization.

\subsection{Matrix Factorization}
Matrix factorization is an algebraic operation consisting in factorising a matrix M, meaning finding the matrices M 1 ,M 2 ,...,M 3 such that when they are multiplied, the resulting matrix is M. In collaborative filtering based recommender systems this can be used as a rather simple and very intuitive algorithm for discovering latent features. By constructing a User-Item matrix M, where each index contains a rating r on an item i performed by a user u:

\[  
\label{eq:ratingmatrix}
\textbf{M\textsubscript{u,i}} = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
r_{{u_1}{i_1}}&r_{{u_1}{i_2}}& \ldots&r_{{u_1}{i_n}} \\
r_{u_2}{i_1}&r_{{u_2}{i_2}}& \ldots&r_{{u_2}{i_n}} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
r_{{u_m}{i_1}}&r_{{u_m}{i_2}}& \ldots&r_{{u_m}{i_n}}
\end{array}
\right)
\]

For example, by limiting the matrix to 4×4 and adding some fictitious values for ratings
where - symbolises yet unrated items, a matrix to be factorised might look something
like \eqref{ratingmatrix}


\[  
\label{eq:numbermatrix}
\textbf{M\textsubscript{u,i}} = \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
5&1&\-&4 \\
3&\-&\-&3 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
2&\-& \ldots&4
\end{array}
\right)
\]

Matrix factorisation can be seen as the task of predicting the missing ratings meaning filling in the blanks (-) in matrix 2.2. Latent features of items liked by different users might be different types of cloths or accessories which might be a shared interest between some users. So for the matrix, 2.2 above, an assumption regarding how many latent features one wishes to find must be made. Let us assume we want to find k latent features and we have the sets U and I containing all users and all items respectively.

This means finding two matrices, N(\textit{a  |U| × k matrix }) and O(\textit{an  |I| × k  matrix}) which when multiplied approximating M:

\[ M \approx N \times O = \hat{M} \]

Further, using similarity and prediction computing techniques as described under 2.2, the gaps can be filled in and thereby resulting in really good recommendations [39].

\section{Similarity Calculation and Prediction Generation}
Similarity and prediction computations compose vital parts of collaborative filtering based recommender systems. Something that can be seen in 2.1.1, 2.1.2 and 2.1.3. The similarity computation is performed before the prediction generation and the basic idea is to first isolate users who have rated two different items, and secondly to apply some similarity computation technique between these two items to determine their similarity. There are several ways of computing the similarity but some common methods are Cosine-based Similarity, Correlation-based Similarity and Adjusted Cosine-based Similarity, Jaccard Similarity, Jaro-Winkler Similarity, Sörensen Similarity.
When the similarity computation is completed, it is time for the most important part in a collaborative filtering based recommender system; generating the output in terms of prediction. As for computing the similarity there are a number of techniques to choose from when generating predictions. Some of the more common methods are using regression or the weighted average/weighted sum.

\section{Content Based Filtering}
Another well known method when implementing recommender systems is content-based filtering[16, 17]. Content-based filtering is commonly used for movie recommendations or within other environments where for instance keywords are used to describe the items of the system. Among the actors of recommendation systems using content-based filtering one can find The Internet Movie Database and other popular websites for movies. The methods of Content-based filtering commonly make use of the correlation between item features and preferences from a user’s profile, as opposed to the collaborative filtering approach that selects items based on the correlation between users with similar profiles. 

For the above to work, the system needs to deploy some learning technique [16, 17] such as Bayesian networks, clustering, decision trees, neural networks, reinforcement learning, Nearest Neighbour etc. The system uses these techniques when observing historical data of users to learn their preferences. The intention is that, after sufficient amounts of data have been observed, the system should be able to predict future behaviour of a specific user.


\subsection{Selecting a (Learning) model}
A key component when implementing a recommender system using content-based filtering is choosing a method for how the algorithm should be trained [16, 17], using available data from the system. Using this data to create a model of a user’s preferences and history in the system can be seen as a kind of classification problem. There are several significantly different methods suitable for solving this, some of which are mentioned in 

2.3. Which one to choose depend on the setting for which it is going to be used. For instance, Bayesian networks are commonly practical in a setting where knowledge about users change slowly, relative to time needed to construct the model. Clustering techniques on the other hand has a tendency to generate less-personal predictions than other methods[40]. Although, due to the nature of clustering, once the clustering process is complete, the new groups of data to be analyzed are significantly smaller than before and performance, in terms of computation time, are thereby likely to be good. Decision trees have shown a tendency of basing classifications on as few instances as possible. Something that has lead to worse performance in the sense of accuracy[41]. Although with a smaller number of structured attributes, the performance and simplicity of decision trees are all advantages when applied in content-based recommender systems. Nearest Neighbour methods are commonly known as old and reliable go-to methods when nothing else works. It has the worst performance in most cases, but are most likely to succeed[17].
