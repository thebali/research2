\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
Recommender System is a very active research field. A number of work has already been mentioned in Chapter 2. Most of the online retail companies and travel companies do very active study in the field. Sihem, Cong et al describe a content based recommender system for travel recommendation in the paper.

The results obtained by applying both Probablistic Matrix Factorization and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation are very satifying and also explained most of the recomendations. The results are superior as compared to other algorithms applied on the same datasets by Amazon. 

In future, we will be pleased to have more work in the stochastic machine learning algorithms applied to Recommendation Systems. More algorithms with much scope must be tested to provide the better clarity in this text review domain.
