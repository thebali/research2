\section{Problem Statement}

"Modeling Product Reviews and Ratings using Latent Factors to provide Recommendations"

In recent times, Recommender systems have reached a position where using only the ratings to predict the new recommendations for users have become out of trend. New techniques are being used Deep Neural Networks, Cross-Domain indexing, Demographical Information Retrieval, Text Analytics, and many others. We are in a state where we want to improve the yet pretty accurate predictions, but using another advanced techniques in collaboration with already established techniques. For this, we have decided to make use of the text reviews along with the ratings on the reviews left by the users. Using the Natural Language Processing, we can generate a combination model with Matrix Factorization techniques which might improve the recommender performance. Our problem is Whether the Matrix Factorization technique and the Combined Model out perform the existing algorthms or not?
